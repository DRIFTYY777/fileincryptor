# SecureFile - Cross-Platform File Encryption and Decryption

SecureFile is a Flutter project that allows you to encrypt and decrypt individual files on both Android and Windows devices. It provides a convenient and secure way to protect sensitive information on your devices.

## Key Features

Cross-Platform: Functions on both Android and Windows using a single codebase built with Flutter.
Strong Encryption: Employs a robust encryption algorithm (specify the algorithm used) to safeguard your data.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a simple and intuitive interface for easy encryption and decryption.
Single File Support (Current): Currently supports encrypting and decrypting individual files. Future development may include multi-file support.
Open Source: The codebase is open-source, allowing customization and contributions from the community.
## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites

Flutter Development Environment: Install Flutter on your development machine (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
Android (Optional):

Run flutter pub get to install the required dependencies.
3. Platform-Specific Setup

- Android:

- Follow additional setup instructions for Android development with Flutter if necessary ([https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).
- Windows:

- Follow guidelines for setting up Flutter desktop development for Windows if needed ([https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).
4. Running the App

- Building for Android:

- Connect your Android device or launch an emulator.
- Run `flutter run` to build and deploy the app to your device.
- Building for Windows:

- Follow the instructions for building and running Flutter desktop apps on Windows ([https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).
5. Using the App

- Launching the App:

- Open the app on your Android device or Windows machine.
- Encryption and Decryption:

- The app's interface will guide you through selecting a file for encryption or decryption.
- Provide a strong password to protect your data during encryption.
- The app will handle the encryption/decryption process and indicate successful completion.
## Security Considerations

Choose a strong and unique password for encryption.
Store your passwords securely and avoid sharing them with anyone.
Backup your encrypted files regularly in case of unexpected device loss or app issues.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or ideas for future features (like multi-file support), feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Notes

The initial version of this project supports single-file encryption/decryption. Future development will focus on adding support for multiple files.
The security of your data ultimately depends on the strength of your password and your overall security practices.
I hope this comprehensive README file empowers you to leverage SecureFile for secure data management on your devices!
